## I'm a software engineer whose goal is to make impressive open source projects.<br/> <br/>I usually work in the following programming languages: <br/>Python, C++, Java, and Web.<br/>I don't go to github very often because my studies take up all my time. But I try to find time.

Well... that's all.

See you soon!
